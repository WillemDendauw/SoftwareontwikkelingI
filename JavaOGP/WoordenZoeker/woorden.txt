Gandhi’s Top Ten Fundamentals for Changing the World

Change
You must be the change you want to see in the world
As human beings our greatness lies not so much in being able to remake the world – that is the myth of the atomic age – as in being able to remake ourselves

Control
Nobody can hurt me without my permission

Forgiveness
The weak can never forgive Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong
An eye for eye only ends up making the whole world blind

Action
An ounce of practice is worth more than tons of preaching

The present moment
I do not want to foresee the future I am concerned with taking care of the present God has given me no control over the moment following

Everyone is human
I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal I own however that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps
It is unwise to be too sure of one’s own wisdom It is healthy to be reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err

Persist
First they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win

Goodness
I look only to the good qualities of men Not being faultless myself I won’t presume to probe into the faults of others
I suppose leadership at one time meant muscles; but today it means getting along with people

Truth
Happiness is when what you think what you say and what you do are in harmony
Always aim at complete harmony of thought and word and deed Always aim at purifying your thoughts and everything will be well

Development
Constant development is the law of life and a man who always tries to maintain his dogmas in order to appear consistent drives himself into a false position
